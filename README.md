#Breast_Cancer_Analysis : Project Overview

* Created a model that predicts if the patient has brast cancer or not 
* performed detailed exploratory data analysis to understand the important features from data.
* Found out that the relation between some columns is almost perfectly linear. for example radius,area,perimeter are indicating the      presence of multicollinearity which could affect the final model performance.
* Handled this problem by dropping highly correlated predictors from the model.

* Applied classification algorithms.
* Best Accuracy is given by Random Forest Classifier of 95.32%

*Various classification algorithms accuracy scores:
